## Beginner level- Visualization

### Create Visuals:
Create a custom visualization tool that allows you to compare two features of a dataset over time using an animated line plot. You can use any public dataset (e.g., from seaborn or kaggle) and should implement this using Matplotlib or Plotly to show an animation of how these two features change relative to each other. Highlight key data points (such as peaks or outliers) in the visualization.


#### Steps for Attempting the Question:
1. Choose a public dataset with at least two time-dependent features (e.g., stock market data or climate data).
You can use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or any website you prefer.
2. Preprocess the data, ensuring that the two chosen features have the same length and are properly aligned.
3. Use Matplotlib or Plotly to create an animated line plot where one line represents each feature.
4. Add annotations or markers to highlight key data points like outliers or peaks.
5. Provide play/pause and step-by-step functionality for the animation.
